== Installation ==
The plugin contains two files, the plugin itself and the accompanying readme. If you download the zip from the official Wordpress site, the plugin will just need activating and configuring . For convenience there is a link to the 'settings' at the Monetate plugin level. This screen is also viewable within the main 'Settings' frame on the left hand side. 

If you are manually uploading the files, you should create a folder inside your plugins folder called <b>monetate-script</b> and add <b>monetate-wordpress-plugin.php</b> to it and continue to configure as described above.
